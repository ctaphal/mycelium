## Federated Learning, Powered by MyCelium, Decentralized ML training on encrypted data 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Mycelium is a federated learning project that harnesses the unused computational power of everyday devices to train AI models, eliminating the need for expensive, centralized data centers. By leveraging IBM's diffprivlib, we implement differential privacy, ensuring that user data remains encrypted and secure while still contributing to powerful AI training.

## Features

- Fully Decentralized: Train AI models using your PC‚Äôs GPU without needing a data center.
- Data Security: Implements IBM‚Äôs diffprivlib to keep data private and secure.
- TensorFlow Integration: Perform machine learning tasks using TensorFlow, split across decentralized nodes.
- Pandas Workflow: Streamlined data handling using pandas for splitting data across nodes.
- Horizontal Averaging: Consolidate insights from multiple nodes to improve model accuracy.
- Energy Efficient: Reduce carbon footprints by eliminating the need for traditional data centers.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to implement Federated Learning:

- IBM diffprivlib ‚Äì For encryption and differential privacy.
- TensorFlow ‚Äì For running machine learning models.
- Modal ‚Äì To simulate user nodes.
- Pandas ‚Äì For data splitting and workflow distribution.
- Python ‚Äì Core programming language for model development.
- npm - Package management

## Installation
MyCelium requires an update version of npm to run.
Install the dependencies and and start the Modal server.

```sh
cd mycelium
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
modal run federated_learning.py # Federated Learning starts here
```
